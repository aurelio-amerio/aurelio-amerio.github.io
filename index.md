# TechyTok! It's time to get crafty!
I'm Aurelio, a master student in theoretical physics at the University of Turin.
This is a website about programming and here I will post the results of my coding experiments, hoping that my work may be usefull for other students and all those who want to delve further in the field of programming applied to physics!
