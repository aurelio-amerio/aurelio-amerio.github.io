# Acknowledgements

I want to thank Elena Pinetti for all the help she has given me in proofreading these lessons and all the effort she has put in identifying which parts were not clear enough or should be rewritten.

I also want the thank the wonderful [Julia community](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=r%2FJulia) on reddit for the feedback and all the kind persons who have pointed out typos and given suggestions on how to improve this series of lesson!
