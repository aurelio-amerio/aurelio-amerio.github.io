I am a PhD student at the Instituto de FÃ­sica Corpuscular in Valencia (Spain). My research interests include machine learning, dark matter, astroparticle physics and cosmology. 

In my free time, when I don't get lost hiking, I like to experiment with new programming techniques that may be useful for my future works.
Since I spend most of my time trying to figure out why my code never works, I decided to start writing some articles on topics I find stimulating. I hope that you will find here something that picks your interest, and stay tuned for future updates and code projects!
