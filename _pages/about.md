I am a Master student in theoretical physics and astrophysics at the University of Turin. I aim to become a researcher in the field of astroparticle physics and, in particular, I'd like to research Dark Matter.

In my free time, I like to experiment with new programming techniques that may be useful for my future works. My interests include machine learning, parallel computing, micro-service orchestration through Docker containers and arduino automation, so stay tuned for future updates and code projects!
